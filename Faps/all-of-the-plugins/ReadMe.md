# Flipper Application Files (FAPs) for Any Firmware with API v26.x
## Apps from this pack should be compatible with OFW with API v26.x (dev branch) or any other firmware build with API 26.x

Apps contains changes needed to compile them on latest firmware, some fixes has been done by @xMasterX

I have decided to not include the "integrated/bundled" FAP files that come with a fresh install of Unleashed. If you need to grab a copy of them for whatever reason, you can do so right from the Unleashed repo.

* Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) of the Unleashed repo.
* Scroll down and download the linked ZIP file from the Assets drop down, under the big install from web link.
* Within that ZIP, you'll find `resources.tar` - open/extract that too and look in the `apps` folder.

## Thank you to the authors!

The Flipper and its community wouldn't be as rich as it is without your contributions and support. Thank you for all you have done.
